npm install -g markdown-it

Create tasks.json#
The next step is to set up the task configuration file tasks.json. To do this, run Terminal > Configure Tasks and click Create tasks.json file from templates. VS Code then presents a list of possible tasks.json templates to choose from. Select Others since we want to run an external command.


 Run the Build Task#
Since there can be more than one build task in more complex environments, we prompt you to pick the task to execute after pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (Run Build Task). In addition, we allow you to scan the output for compile problems. Since we only want to convert the Markdown file to HTML, select Never scan the build output from the presented list.
